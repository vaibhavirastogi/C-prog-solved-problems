# C-prog-solved-problems
EDA Playground zipped collection of several solved C-programming problems code


Well, obviously, I haven't tried to run the C code in EDA playground. It's just a convenient collection of a myriad of C problems from GeeksForGeeks which I solved in the Programiz compiler and then just collected the solution codes in EDA playground!

Here's also the EDA Playground link:
